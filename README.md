# IDify
The goal of this project was to create a website that generates a Spotify playist from your favorite DJ mix or live performance 
After linking your Spotify account, all you need to input the URL of your favorite from 1001Tracklists.com and a playlist will be created for you!

# Techonolgies Used
I created this Python application using the Flask Framework with some CSS and HTML for the front end interface. I used the Spotify Web API to connect to the users account for the playlist creation. I also added MongoDB to collect information on the songs that are being added to playlists through my site

# Additions
The next steps for this project is to deploy the website using Heroku so I can share the website with everyone.
